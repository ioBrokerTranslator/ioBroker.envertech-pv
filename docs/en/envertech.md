# Envertech-PV Adapter Information

## General information

Access to envertech portal is secured by username / password combination. Envertech supports end user accounts and installation accounts. This adapter is only tested with end user accounts which allow access to exact one installation per account only. Each end user account is assigned to a station-id by envertech. The adapter allows cusage of multiple station-ids per adapter instance. This enables monitoring of more than one installation within one instance.

-   station information identified by station id
-   one or more gateways associated with the station identified by the gateways serial number
-   one or more inverter connected to those gateways.
